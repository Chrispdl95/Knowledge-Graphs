# Knowledge-Graphs
## In this repo i implement some techniques of study, analysis and extraction of knowledge from the web and social networks.
## Briefly, this repo contains:

### 1. Community detection techniques:
Detect communities with different techniques. Working with polblogs network, a directed graph from hyperlinks between blogs on US politics recorded in 2005 by Adamic and Glance, we'll try to apply and compare the performance of different community detection techniques, with respect to the ground-truth communities given.

### 2. Node Embeddings
Production and evaluation of Node Embeddings. Working with polbooks network, a directed graph from Books about US Politics Dataset, we produce node embeddings using Node2Vec and then evaluate their performance using them for Link Prediction and K-Means Clustering, with respect to the ground-truth communities given.

### 3. Neo4j and Cypher
Α. Implementation of a database in Neo4j and entering the data given. 
Β. Retrieval queries in Cypher.
